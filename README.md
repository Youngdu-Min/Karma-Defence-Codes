A defense game where you fight off demons to protect a stone statue  
Solely responsible for all programming — including object pooling, quest system, and custom editor

## Key Features

- **Object Pooling**: Multiple unit types are interleaved under a single parent object and activated via an index formula, improving memory efficiency
- **Quest System**: Quest completion per stage is persisted via PlayerPrefs with duplicate prevention logic to ensure star count integrity
- **Custom Editor**: Hides irrelevant inspector fields based on unit type (melee / ranged) and displays numeric values as sliders for faster iteration
- **Permanent & Temporary Upgrades**: Permanent upgrades are unlocked by accumulated quest stars; temporary upgrades are purchased with in-stage currency

## Implementation Details

### 1. Multi-Type Object Pooling

A pooling system that efficiently manages multiple unit types under a single parent object.

**Core Design**

- On initialization, units are instantiated in alternating order (e.g. 3 types → `0 1 2 0 1 2 ...`)
- On spawn, the system scans forward from the requested unit's index to find the next inactive slot
- If the pool is exhausted, its size doubles dynamically via reallocation

Spawn cooldowns are managed with a single 1D array using the formula:  
`spawnTime[(arrayLength / unitTypes) * unitIndex + currentStage]`  
This maps each combination of unit type and stage to a unique cooldown without nested structures.

### 2. Per-Stage Quest System

Up to 3 quests are available per stage, and completing them awards stars (★).

**Core Design**

- Quest completion is persisted via `PlayerPrefs`
- Key format: `stageNumber + questIndex` (e.g. Stage 1, Quest 3 → `"13"`)
- Duplicate completion is prevented to maintain accurate star counts

**Quest Types**: Stage clear, spawn N or more units of a specific type, etc.

### 3. Unit Type–Based Custom Editor

Irrelevant inspector fields are automatically hidden based on unit type (`Shooter` / `Fighter`), reducing editor clutter.

| Unit Type | Visible Fields |
|-----------|----------------|
| Shooter (Ranged) | Projectile, ShootPos |
| Fighter (Melee) | AttackSound |
| Common | Damage, AttackRange, AttackSpeed, Speed, IncHp, IncDam, DecAttSp |

Shared numeric values are displayed as sliders for intuitive editing.

**How to Use**

1. Select the unit type from the `Class` field on the `Unit` script
2. Only the relevant fields for that type will appear in the inspector
3. Numeric values such as Damage can be adjusted directly via slider
